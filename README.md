Hello everyone, myself **S Deepak Kumar**. I never went to collage (i.e. studied till 10th standard). I'm self learned coder, love to do **Web** & **App Development** stuffs. I've worked & completed numerious projects for clients including start-ups, schools/universities and NGOs. I love to provide simplest solution to any given problems.

I'm winner of **🏆 TCO21 Velo By Wix Hackthon** & **🏆 Wix Skill Builder Challenge**. I was **Shining Star Member** (February 2022 newsletter) of Topcoder.

Also, **Topcoder** invites me as a special guest on the **Topcoder Nation Show#12** (hosted by Luis Millan).

I love to explore new technologies & implement it in future projects. I hardly believe in this quote:
><b>If You Can't Make Yourself Understandable, No One Can Make You Understandable.</b>

I also love exploring new places & try to immersing myself in their culture.
